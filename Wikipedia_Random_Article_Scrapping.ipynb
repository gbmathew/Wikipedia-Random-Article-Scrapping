King Peter IV agreed and informed Gilabert de Centelles about the reservations the Jews had about the place, and ordered that a legal expert trusted by the community be appointed to pick a proper location.\n",

The King decreed that the difference between the appraised value of the houses and the amount paid for them would need to be covered by the University of Inca, which sparked confrontations between house owners and the university.\n",
      "\n",
      "A committee of two Christians and two Jews was appointed to negotiate the sale and rent prices for the houses in the call, but the University sent a written complaint to the King and the whole process was paralyzed for 10 years. The Governor then gave the order to comply with the King's mandate and resume the process, but it was not actually done until 1363, under new Governor Bernardo de Tous. A new appraisal committee, with two Christians named Montroig and Palou, and two Jews named Faquim and Fallux, was chosen.\n",
      "\n",
      "No written record of the place exists between 1363 and 1372. It is known that the previous owners of the confiscated houses appealed to the authorities with new complaints about the prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1372, the secretaries of the aljama filed a complaint because routine attacks by Christians on Jews were pushing Jews to leave. Governor Tous ordered the building of two gates to keep the Jewish quarter enclosed so Christians would not assault Jews. Until then only one gate had existed, called En Reboll.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Jewish quarter of Inca can be considered the secondary aljama of Majorca. The main one was in Palma, but beginning in 1383 the secretaries of the aljama in Palma delegated functions on their peers in Inca, making the community effectively independent. This arrangement was short-lived as the neighborhood was destroyed in 1391 and most of the survivors converted to Christianity.\n",
      "\n",
      "All evidences indicate that the call had a synagogue. In documents from 1392, convert Bartomeua claimed inheritance rights on properties owned by her grandfather \"Jucef Ben Baharon, rabbi of the Jewish School of the Call.\"\n",

      "In the town map made by Dr. Sebastià Sans in 1808, the Jewish quarter appears as \"El Call\" and numbered with 10.\n",

      "Based on an investigation conducted by Antoni Ginard, Joan Estrany and Francesca Tugores at the University of the Balearic Islands, Jeroni de Berard is currently believed to have made in 1790 the oldest map of Inca, later used by his sometimes collaborator Sebastià Sans to make his own in 1808.\n",

      "Cyclopentane (also called C pentane) is a highly flammable alicyclic hydrocarbon with chemical formula C5H10 and CAS number 287-92-3, consisting of a ring of five carbon atoms each bonded with two hydrogen atoms above and below the plane. It occurs as a colorless liquid with a petrol-like odor. Its melting point is −94 °C and its boiling point is 49 °C. Cyclopentane is in the class of cycloalkanes, being alkanes that have one or more rings of carbon atoms.

      "John James \"Jack\" Snelling (born 8 November 1972) is a former Australian politician. He was the Labor member for the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Playford from the 1997 election until his retirement in 2018. Snelling left the Labor Party in 2021 to found the Family First Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to his election into politics, Snelling was an electoral officer, and a staffer in the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA).[2] Snelling was a supporter of the work of Christopher Pearson.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Entering parliament in 1997 at the age of 24, he was the youngest member of the House of Assembly at the time.

He is aligned with Labor's right faction.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "A consequence of the major 2016 electoral redistribution was that two thirds of the voters in Snelling's electorate of Playford will be moved to Florey. On 15 March 2017 he won Labor preselection to be the candidate for Florey at the 2018 election. The incumbent member for Florey, Frances Bedford, had also nominated for pre-selection.[5] On 28 March 2017, Bedford resigned from the party after they endorsed Snelling for the seat.[6] A ReachTEL poll conducted on 2 March 2017 of 606 voters in post-redistribution Florey indicated a 33.4 percent primary vote for Bedford running as an independent which would likely see Snelling defeated after preferences.[7] Snelling withdrew from the pre-selection on 17 September 2017.[8]\n",
